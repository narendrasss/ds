# Linked Lists

A linked list is a data structure where each element contains a _pointer_ to the next element. The elements are not laid out contiguously but rather tells you where you can find the next element in the list.

## Variants

The most basic of linked lists is called a **singly linked list**. "Singly" means that each "node" in the list has a pointer to the next item, but does not know what item came before it.

A linked list usually only has a reference to the start or "head" of the list.
