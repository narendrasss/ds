# AVL Tree

An AVL tree is a special type of binary search tree that **maintains balance**.

The performance of a BST is reliant on its height, `h`. In the worst case, a BST's height can be equal to its number of nodes, making it a glorified linked list:

```
1
└───────────────┐
                2
                └───────┐
                        3
                        └───┐
                            4
                            └─┐
                              5
                              └┐
                               6
```

> The above tree was generated by inserting a sorted array into a BST.

In this case, if we want to find the node corresponding to 6, we would have to iterate through the _entire_ tree.

If we add our values in a different order we can get a more optimal tree:

```
  3
┌─┴─┐
1   5
└┐ ┌┴┐
 2 4 6
```

Now we only have to do 2 checks to find the node corresponding to 6. This tree is considered to be **balanced**.

An AVL tree **guarantees** that our tree is balanced, regardless of the order in which we insert our values. It does this by rotating sections of the tree whenever that section becomes out of balance.
